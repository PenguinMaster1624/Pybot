# Pybot

## A basic Discord Bot with some commands coming from other, more sophisticated bots while also having some unique commands

### The prefix for the bot is "Pybot.", and be sure to include the period
#### All but the first command are now Slash Commands, and therefore the first command is the only one that uses the prefix stated above

#### The commands include as follows:
###### Pybot.hello                  <-- Pretty much this bot's version of the ping pong command. The only one that uses the prefix "Pybot." now
###### /purge                       <-- Your common purge command. Only people with the "Manage Messsages" permission can use this
###### /choose <str1, str 2>, [str 3], [str 4] <-- Chooses one of the given choices randomly, you can input however many strings
###### /mk8bm                       <-- Chooses one of the maps from the battle mode in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. Sure it's already got this, but it was fun to make
###### /fac                         <-- Flips a coin
###### /help                        <-- A help command that pulls up all available commands
