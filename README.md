# Python Bot 3.0

## A basic bot with some commands coming from other, more sophisticated bots while also having some unique commands

### The prefix for the bot is "Pybot.", and be sure to include the period
#### All but the first command are now Slash Commands, and therefore the first command is the only one that uses the prefix stated above

#### The commands include as follows:
###### hello                       <-- Pretty much this bot's version of the ping pong command
