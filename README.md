# Python-Bot-3.0

# A basic bot with some commands coming from other, more sophisticated bots while also having some unique commands
# As the name implies, this was made in Python

# The commands include as follows:
# .repeat <str, [ChannelID]>   <-- The channel ID is optional, it will repeat what you input in the current channel (when no channel ID is provided) or in another channel
# .hello                       <-- Pretty much this bot's version of the ping pong command
# .choose <str1, "str 2", etc> <-- Chooses one of the given choices randomly, you can input however many strings
# .purge <int />               <-- Deletes the amount of messages inputted. Make sure to add one more to said number to account for the one you
# .mk8bm                       <-- Chooses one of the maps from the battle mode in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. Sure it's already got this, but it was fun to make
# .mk8m <[Cup]>                <-- Chooses a track from an inputted cup from Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. If not cup is inputted, it will default to the General pool
# .pbgm                        <-- Chooses any game mode available in Splatoon 2's Private Battle randomly
# .rsw <[Weapon Class]>        <-- Chooses a weapon line. You get to choose which one you play with that name). Will default to every class if none specified
