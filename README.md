# Python Bot 3.0

## A basic bot with some commands coming from other, more sophisticated bots while also having some unique commands
## As the name implies, this was made in Python

#### The commands include as follows:
###### .hello                       <-- Pretty much this bot's version of the ping pong command
###### .choose <str1, "str 2", etc> <-- Chooses one of the given choices randomly, you can input however many strings
###### .purge <int />               <-- Deletes the amount of messages inputted. Only people with the Manage Messages permission can use this command
###### .mk8bm                       <-- Chooses one of the maps from the battle mode in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. Sure it's already got this, but it was fun to make
###### .mk8m <[Cup]>                <-- Chooses a track from an inputted cup from Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. If not cup is inputted, it will default to the General pool
###### .pbgm                        <-- Chooses any game mode available in Splatoon 2's Private Battle randomly
###### .rsw <[Weapon Class]>        <-- Chooses a weapon line. You get to choose which one you play with that name). Will default to every class if none specified
###### .join                        <-- Joins the voice call you're in. Will not join if you aren't in one
###### .dc                          <-- Disconnects from a voice call. Works when you're not in a vc
###### .rot <msg, number>           <-- rotates a message a specified number of letters in the alphabet forward. Only creator of this bot can use this
###### .mt <msg>                    <-- turns a message into morse code. Only creator of this bot can use this
###### .bt <msg>                    <-- turns a message into binary code. Only creator of this bos can use this
###### .join                        <-- Joins the voice channel you're in. Can be moved to a new one if you're in it
###### .dc                          <-- Leaves a voice call. This can be a little finnicky when you're not in it
